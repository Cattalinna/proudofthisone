        <p>     For this assignment the hardest thing to do was by far getting the data from the API. </br>
            Once I finally understood how to get the info and print it on the page, I watched a few videos </br> 
            to figure out how to add this info on a table. I figured out that I needed</br> 
            to add an id to the body of the table. Once this one is added then instead of just printing out</br> 
            the data we can arrange it by adding the table data tags in parentheses before and after the data, which,</br>
            would be added to the html along with the data, creating the table body. Thankfully, everything else was able to </br>
            go smoothly, making the only significant problem the AJAX calls and visualization, most especifically the tables. </br>
